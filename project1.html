                Pets are a great blessing in anyone’s life. They are the only ones who love us unconditionally. 
                Pets always offer us everything they have without asking for anything in return. The main aim of any pet’s life is to make their owner happy. 
                Nowadays, even the term ‘owner’ is changing. People prefer their pets as kids and to themselves as parents. This is how the relationship between pets is evolving.
                 People treat them no less than humans. For instance, they celebrate their birthdays; get those matching outfits and more.

                The popularity of the cat, especially of pedigreed breeds, has continued to grow. The cat’s independent
                 personality, grace, cleanliness, and subtle displays of affection have wide appeal. Typically, cats are creatures 
                 of habit; they are inquisitive, but not adventurous, and are easily upset by sudden changes of routine. The ideal
                  household cat has been separated from its mother between the ages of two and four months, raised in a clean home, 
                  kept away from unhealthy animals, and inoculated against common infectious cat diseases. Although cats often enjoy 
                  the company of other cats, especially when raised together from kittenhood, introducing a strange cat to other cats
                   in the home can cause stress, aggression, and other behaviour problems. Cats are generally less sociable than dogs,
                    who more readily accept a new pack member
